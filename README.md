### Description: 
Today I decided to focus on calling and catching API's. For the API, I used Reqres to test fake data that was being genereated and I converted the data to JSON format. I also used the 'Catch' command to log the error in the console log, allowing me to test the API and seeing the error being logged if there was a problem. The error would only be displayed if the API key was modified.
